=== Front End ===
The OpenRefine front end has been localized using [[jquery-i18n plugin|https://github.com/newage/jquery-i18n]]. The translation is handled using a dictionary (a JSON object), retrieved with a new OpenRefine Command.

The JSON dictionnary should be added to the 
* https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/tree/master/main/webapp/modules/langs/ for the main interface
*  https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/tree/extensions/freebase/module/langs/ for freebase extension
*  https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/tree/extensions/gdata/module/langs/ for google spreadsheet connection

An Italian translation is available as example. 

=== Server / Back end ===
Additional work needs to be done on to localize the Refine server, so things like error messages, undo history , etc may appear in non-localized (ie English) form.
