//OpenRefine Roadmap//

This list is from pre-2.2 days and needs to be reprioritized and cleaned up.

Please be aware that none of this is carved in stone and can change any time, so check back regularly.

==2.2==

Feature Areas

* Internationalization
* Streamlining traditional features
* Issue 213: traditional find & replace
* Issue 68: "merge columns" command.

Issues

* Issue 36: Seamless conversion of arrays into multiple columns
* Issue 75: Saveable reconciliation mappings
* Issue 87: Long running processes should serialize intermediate results ? - hard (dfhuynh)

==2.5==

Feature Areas:

* Views: map, timeline, protovis charts

Issues

* Better machinery to guess and re-encode cell values (useful for fixing encoding issues)
 
==3.0==

Feature Areas:

* Collaborative editing support (really hard)
* RABJ integration (allows to distribute reconciliation loads across multiple people) - not even sure what this means

==Future==

Feature Areas:

* Performance - the /project page seems to be slow now
* Column groups
* [[issue 93|https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues#issue/93]]

Issues

* Issue 85: Graphical manipulation of widths of fixed-width column data

* Issue 91: Option or preference to only show Freebase /common types in dropdowns for type and property suggestions.
* Issue 94: Map facet?
