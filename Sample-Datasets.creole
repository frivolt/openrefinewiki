//List of sample datasets that you can use to try out OpenRefine.//

Here are a few sample data sets to get you started on understanding how to use OpenRefine

* [[Disasters worldwide from 1900-2008 at Infochimps|http://infochimps.org/datasets/disasters-worldwide-from-1900-2008]] (dead link)
* [[Louisiana elected officials|http://electionstatistics.sos.la.gov/Data/Elected_Officials/ElectedOfficials.xls]] - For OpenRefine versions up to 2.0, you must use Excel itself to convert the .xls file to a .tsv file first because the Java library for dealing with .xls files doesn't like this particular .xls file. OpenRefine versions 2.1 and above will successfully load the .xls directly
