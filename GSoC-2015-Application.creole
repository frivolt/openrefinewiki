==== Describe your organization. ==== 

We are developing OpenRefine (formely Google Refine and freebase Gridwork), a free, open source, powerful tool for working with messy data.

Since Google stop supporting Refine in 2012, the project is run solely on volunteer basis. With Google Summer of Code we hope to attract new contributors to the projects on a long term basis.

 ==== What criteria did you use to select the mentors? Please be as specific as possible. ==== 

We used the following criteria to select mentors: 
* Time commitment / availability of at least 8h a week
* Existing committers on OpenRefine trunk with knowledge of our codebase. 

 ==== What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? Please be as specific as possible ==== 

We think our idea proposition is appealing and student will be interested to do so and commit for the lenght of the GSoC program. We will make sure through our selection process to work only with student motivated and serious about the program and his idea is realistic in the timeframe.

Student will share on a weekly basis their progress with the community via our discussion list. Code review and mentoring will be done publicaly via GitHub. The goal of those weekly report is to detect risk of drop out as early as possile and act accordingly.

Since the mentoring will be public, if students really leave, we can take over the project and continue it using other resource.
 
 ==== What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? Please be as specific as possible. ==== \
All communication between the student and the mentor will be public on the developer mailing list making it easy for a back up mentor to jump in and replace a disappearing mentors.

Since this is the first application for OpenRefine to Google Summer of Code we also plan to limit the number of student to one or two maximum so mentor can provide adequate level of support to the student.

 ==== What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program? ==== 

Before: we will invite student to share their idea and engage with the developer community via our discussion list.

During: Regular update on the student progress via his personal blog or / and by updating the community via our discussion list. 

After: There is plenty to do with OpenRefine, from preparing the next release to developing extension and reconciliation service. We will encourage student to continue their involvement with the community.
