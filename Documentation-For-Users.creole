=Feature Areas=

**Essential:** These are the features you'd use 80% of the time when you use Refine. They help you clean up your data, extend it, and export it out for other tools to consume.

** [[Importers|Importing]]
** [[Faceting|Filtering / faceting]]
** Editing:
** [[Cell Editing|Editing cells]], editing cells by [[Clustering|Clustering]]
** [[Column Editing|Editing columns]], creating columns by [[Extending Data|Extending data]]
** [[Row Editing|Editing rows]]
** [[Understanding Expressions|Understanding expressions]]
** [[Understanding Regular Expressions|Understanding regular expressions]]
** [[Exporters|Exporting]]
** [[History|History]] (undo/redo)

**Reconciliation:** You can use the "reconciliation" support in Refine to link text names in your data to database identifiers (also known as database keys, IDs). By connecting your data with other databases, you get more value out of your data.

** [[Reconciliation]]
** [[Reconcilable Data Sources|Data sources]]
** [[Extending Data|Extending Data - Calling Web Services]]
** [[Extending Data From Freebase|Extending Data - Using Freebase]]

**Uploading to Freebase:**
If you reconcile against [[http://www.freebase.com/|Freebase]], you can then align your data with Freebase's schemas using [[Schema Alignment|Schema Alignment dialogs]] and load your data into Freebase. For more information on Freebase data loading, see the [[http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/Refinery|Refinery project]].
