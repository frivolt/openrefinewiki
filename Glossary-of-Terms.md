Blank Down: Blank down means to replace the duplicate entries in subsequent rows with blanks. This forms gaps between rows of identical values in a column. I.E. "Blank down to replace the IDs of
duplicate rows by blanks (every original row will keep its ID, only subsequent ones
will lose them). " This is a common step in converting from Rows to Records.
